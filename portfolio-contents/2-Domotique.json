  "description": "Domotique is a project that aims to create a smart home system. The system is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing users to add new features and devices as needed. The system is controlled via a web interface, which allows users to monitor and control various aspects of their home, such as lighting, heating, and security. The system also includes a mobile app, which provides users with remote access to their home system. The project is still in development, but the team is working hard to bring it to market as soon as possible."
